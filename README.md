Layoff Prediction using WARN Database

This project analyzes U.S. layoff trends using the WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) database. By exploring real-time data across states, cities, and industries, the goal is to uncover patterns, identify high-risk sectors, and forecast future layoffs using machine learning techniques.

### Highlights:
- Analyzed layoffs by **state, city, and industry**
- Identified peak layoff periods (e.g., April 2020 â€“ 14.8% unemployment)
- Used **EDA and forecasting** models to predict future layoffs
- Visualized geographic and sector-based vulnerabilities
- Proposed **future enhancements** including dashboards and global layoff tracking

### Tools & Tech:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn
